Displacement (Su): Any melee or ranged attack directed at Ripper

some means other than sight. A true seeing effect allows the user to
see the beastâ€™s position, but see invisibility has no effect.
Resistance to Ranged Attacks (Su): A displacer beast gains a +2
resistance bonus on saves against any ranged spell or ranged magical
attack that specifically targets it, except for ranged touch attacks.
Smite Good (Su): Once per day, Ripper gains a +10 bonus on a sin-
gle damage roll against a good foe.
