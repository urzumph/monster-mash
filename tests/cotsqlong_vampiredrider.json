For each negative level bestowed, the drider vampire heals 5 points of damage. If the amount of healing is more than the damage the creature has taken, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. If the negative level has not been removed (with a spell such as restoration) before 24 hours have passed, the afflicted opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 18) to remove it. Failure means the opponent’s level (or Hit Dice) is reduced by one."

An unwilling, intelligent target that fails a Will saving throw (DC 18) obeys one command as if under a suggestion spell. A successful save allows the creature to resist the command, but the drider vampire can attempt to command it again next round. Commanding an unwilling target requires a standard action; otherwise, issuing commands is a free action."
